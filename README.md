# PROBLEM STATEMENT
1.	Measuring the effectiveness of the campaign
2.	Deep dive into which sections of the audience the campaign performed well, and where it didn’t

Test a lot of hypotheses and ask questions that make business sense as well. Some examples – 
1.	Do customers with higher education have higher propensity to subscribe to a term deposit?
2.	Does current balance have an effect on their subscription?
